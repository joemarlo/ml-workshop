## Production'izing

Putting it out there: apps, apis, packages, servers, algo fairness

model version'ing


## Time series models

Not covered here but see packages: forecast, fable, modeltime (more in the tidymodels framework)

## Reproducibility

### renv

packrat

## Good habits

Prefixing, writing as a package or like a package. Unit tests (testthat); style guides; comments


## Final thoughts

Easy to do the wrong thing â€“ common pitfalls. Think hard about what the model would actually see in practice

creating a feature within a time series model that is just the lagged predictor

running feature selector once for all CV folds
